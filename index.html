            The <em>Akan</em> people of Ghana frequently name their children
            after the day of the week they were born and the order in which they
            were born. These "day names" have further meanings concerning the
            soul and character of the person. Middle names have considerably
            more variety and can refer to their birth order, twin status, or an
            ancestor's middle name. This naming tradition is shared throughout
            West Africa and the African diaspora. During the 18thâ€“19th
            centuries, enslaved people in the Caribbean from the region that is
            modern-day Ghana were referred to as Coromantees. Many of the
            leaders of enslaved people's rebellions had "day names" including
            Cuffy, Cuffee or Kofi, Cudjoe or Kojo, Quao or Quaw, and Quamina or
            Kwame/Kwamina. Most Ghanaians have at least one name from this
            system, even if they also have an English or Christian name. Notable
            figures with day names include Ghana's first president Kwame Nkrumah
            and former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
